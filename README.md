# woocommerce_categoryinfo
A small Wordpress plugin for WooCommerce to add category information to order line_items sent to webhooks.

If you wanna know how it works, read the code. I'm definitely the type who comments code.

This entire thing needs a re-write. Writing this plugin was how I learned WordPress, and it definitely reflects my complete lack of experience... Now that I have a bit of a better understanding of how you're supposed to do things in WordPress, I'm gonna redo this whole thing.
