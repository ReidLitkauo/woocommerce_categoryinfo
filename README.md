# woocommerce_categoryinfo
A small Wordpress plugin for WooCommerce to add category information to order line_items sent to webhooks.

Sometimes you'd like WooCommerce to tell your webhooks what categories your products are in. This plugin will make that happen.

Currently under active development, caveat emptor.
